\section{Key idea}
Incrementally search the simplest pair of (task, solver) without forgetting old skills.
Suppose old solver can solve a set of tasks, we search for new task under following conditions
\begin{enumerate}
    \item New task cannot be solved by old solver
    \item New task can be solved by new solver (updated from old solver)
    \item New solver can also solve old skills (Prevent forgetting/Reuse old skills)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Algorithm}
Let $\cB$ be a set of bit strings encoding programs such as scalar, vector, matrices etc. We define $\cS\subset\cB$ as a set of possible solvers and $\mathcal{T}\subset\cB$ as a set of possible tasks. The PowerPlay algorithm is shown in the following

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoNoLine
    Initialize a solver $s_0$\\
    \For{$i = 1, 2, \dots$}{
        \Repeat{$s_{i-1}$ cannot solve $T$ and $s_i^'$ can solve both $T$ and $T_{k<i}$}{
            Invent new task $T\in\mathcal{T}$ and update a new solver candidate $s_{i}^'$ from $s_{i-1}$
        }
        Set $T_i\leftarrow T$ and $s_i\leftarrow s_i^'$
    }
